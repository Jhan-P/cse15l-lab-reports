# Lab Report 3 - Exploring the `grep` command

## The `grep` command
Standing for "global regular expression print", the `grep` command in Linux is used to locate text patterns within specific files or files within a directory. 
Much like the `find` command, the `grep` command also has various options to narrow down searches. In this report, we will be exploring the `-i`, `-v`, `-n`, 
and `-c` options.

## The `-i` option
Adding the `-i` option after a `grep` command will search for the given string in a case-insensitive manner.




## The `-v` option


## The `-n` option
